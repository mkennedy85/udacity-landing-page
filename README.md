# Landing Page Project

## Project

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Development

This project does not contain a runtime, but can be viewed by opening the index.html in a browser. All styling is currently in a single `css/style.css` file, while all script functionality is in the `js/app.js` file.

## Demo

This page is hosted as a demo on Github Pages at [https://mkennedy85.github.io/udacity-landing-page/](https://mkennedy85.github.io/udacity-landing-page/)

## Compatibility

The project is developed using many current standards, maintaining compatibility with most browsers, but it should be noted that `scroll-behavior (CSS)` and `scrollTo({options}) (Javascript)` are not supported across all browsers.

## Acknowledgments

Most code was developed using [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) as a reference.

The `scrollToTopButton` was created with an excellent resource found on YouTube, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK5DEa1Hvco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK5DEa1Hvco).
